    <!-- Company Background -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>My name is Jakyi Humphrey, and I’m the CEO of Elo Cybersecurity. We began our journey as a small project in my mom's basement, powered by a vision to make cybersecurity education accessible to everyone. Alongside my co-founder Joe, we built Elo with a passion for helping people stay safe online—without charging them for essential knowledge and tools.</p>
      <p>Our company was founded on resilience, innovation, and a commitment to digital safety. Through hard work and community support, Elo Cybersecurity continues to grow as a trusted platform for cybersecurity awareness and solutions.</p>
